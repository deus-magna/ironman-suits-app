The suit was later used as a model for Obadiah Stane\'s Iron Monger...\n\nIt was featured in the movie Iron Man, and first appeared when Tony and Ho Yinsen were held captive by the terrorist group known as the Ten Rings. While they were held captive, Tony and Yinsen devised a plan. In the cave, they created blueprints for the Mark I.\n\nThe suit was very crude, due to the limited tools and resources that were available. Its successor was the Mark II, built inside the Stark Mansion.\n\nThe suit has several notable functionalities and weapons. It is equipped with a Manually Deployed Rocket Launcher, a Flamethrower mounted on each arm, Jet Boots equipped in its soles, an exposed Internal System attached to its back, and the very first Miniature Arc Reactor in the center of its chest. This reactor powers the entire suit. Later, Tony created an upgraded version that would power almost every other suit to date.',

Helicarrier.\n\nThe suit was built for heavy combat, and was heavily armed with weapons.\n\nThe armor has a unique feature that involves forming itself into a large pod, and when opened, had mechanical arms, that could extend and reach onto Tony\'s arms, grabbing them and quickly wrapping itself around him. This was done through the use of two special metallic bracelets, both of which had encrypted codes embedded within them in the black rectangular spaces.
